# Enigma Access Management

![BrowserStack Logo](https://d98b8t1nnulk5.cloudfront.net/production/images/layout/logo-header.png?1469004780)

Manage access to tools through a single portal.

## What is Enigma?

Enigma is a web-based internal Access Management Tool that:
* helps employees get access to various in-house and third-party systems and components like git repositories, cloud machines (via ssh), and dashboards
* facilitates book-keeping
* helps with compliance
* manages the inventory of all the tools in one place


This tool consists of 2 different components: a central web server and pluggable access modules.
This repo is the code base for the central web server.
Refer to [this](https://github.com/browserstack/enigma-public-access-modules) for published access modules with this tool.

Refer to [this doc](/docs/%E2%80%9CHow-to%E2%80%9D%20guides/Adding%20Modules.md) on how to create custom access modules

### Problems Solved

Enigma access management tool was developed internally at BrowserStack to solve some of the problems we observed around access management for employees

* No single portal for an individual to view his/her access across tools
* No single portal to manage access for employees across vendors
* No central audit trail across tools for access granted and revoked for employees
* Repetitive Ops for DevOps teams and tool owners for access grant and revoke requests
* No standardized SOC2-compliant and GDPR-compliant method for managing individual and admin access for external tools
* No simple consolidated pipeline to trigger offboarding an exit-ing employee to revoke all employee access across tools
* No way for an individual to maintain separate identiy per tool
  * Individuals might have multiple accounts for a single tool, there can be multiple org-wide domains for certain tools
* No way to request, audit and track employee access outside of org-team hierarchy. Adhoc teams / groups support is needed.
  * employees might migrate across teams, sometimes access are needed for temporary projects which are not required for the whole team
* No way of listing a bunch of access to grant to employees working on a project
  * In case an individual is added to a project, access request for all relavant tools should be raised with a single click (based on knowledge-base build on other individuals working on the project)

## Usage

The following steps are for hosting Enigma locally from published docker container images.

For development setup, follow this [doc](/docs/one-click-dev.md)

#### Pre-requisites

You will need to have docker daemon running locally to run the published containers.
If you don't have docker setup, follow the guidelines [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

#### Steps

1. Ensure you have a valid `config.json` present locally.

The default [config.json.sample](https://github.com/browserstack/enigma-public-central/blob/main/config.json.sample) should be sufficient to start.

You can then add module-specific configuration for the modules you want to be integrated with Enigma.
For detailed instructions on configuration, follow [this doc](/docs/Configuration%20Guide.md)

2. Run the Enigma docker container by mounting the downloaded config to the container

```bash
docker run --rm --name enigma -p 8000:8000 -v "$(pwd)/config.json":/srv/code/dev/config.json browserstack/enigma:v1
```

Ensure that the 8000 port is free to use, and ensure that path to config.json is correct.

That's it! Enigma should be running locally on port 8000

## Contributing to this tool

- The codebase is tested for Python 3.11.0
- Setup pre-commit hooks for development (see rules [below](#rules-enforced-by-the-pre-commit-hooks))
  - run: `npm install @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional`
  - run: `pip install pre-commit==2.21.0`
  - run: `pre-commit install --install-hooks --overwrite` in the base directory of this project
  - run: `pre-commit autoupdate`
  - run: `pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure --color always`

#### Commit Message Guideline

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`<scope>` is optional

`Type` can be of the following type:

- `feat`: new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script
- `fix`: bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script
- `docs`: changes to the documentation
- `style`: formatting, missing semi-colons, etc; no production code change
- `refactor`: refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable
- `test`: adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change
- `chore`: updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change
- `bump`: increase the version of something e.g. dependency
- `build`: changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `perf`: a code change that improves performance
- `revert`: revert to a commit

#### Example

```
