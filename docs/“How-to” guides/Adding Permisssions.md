Once a user is successfully onboarded to Enigma, assign them a role based on their access level.
Permissions are added to roles which makes it easier to assign the same set of permissions to multiple users.

Following are the default permissions for Enigma:
Permission | Description

ALLOW_USER_OFFBOARD | User authorised to remove user from a group and the organisation
VIEW_USER_LIST | User authorised to view details of all users
VIEW_USER_ACCESS_LIST | User authorised to view access of all users
ACCESS_APPROVE | User authorised to approve/decline access requests
