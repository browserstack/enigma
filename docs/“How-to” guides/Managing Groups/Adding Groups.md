This document describes how to add groups on Enigma.

A Group can be created to simplify assigning the same set of access to multiple users.
To create a group:
- Select 'Create New Group' from Group section in the left side panel on Enigma Dashboard.
- Fill in the form with the required details and click on 'Submit Request'.
```
Note: The owner/creator of the group will by default be added to the group, so requester will not see their own name in the users for selection.
```
- Once request is submitted, approver will be notified to review the request.

Users and their access can be added once the group creation request is approved.
