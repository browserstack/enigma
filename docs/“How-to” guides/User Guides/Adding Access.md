This document describes how to raise individual access requests for modules on Enigma.

- Navigate to 'Resource Creation Requests'>'Module Access Request' from dashboard. When new Access module is added it is populated in the Access List dropdown with the defined value for `access_desc`.
- User can select one or more options from this list and click on 'Proceed'
- The templates for selected modules will load and the user is prompted to fill the form with required details.
- If access module uses identity other than user's email ID, access will not be raised until it is updated successfully.
    Refer to [Creating User Identity](/docs/%E2%80%9CHow-to%E2%80%9D%20guides/Adding%20User%20Identity.md)
- Once request is submitted, approver will be notified to review the request.
- Requester can view status on 'My Access' page.
