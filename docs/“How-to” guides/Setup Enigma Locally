# Setup Enigma Locally

## Pre-requisites
You should have python3 installed on your system and checked out the enigma repository locally.


## Steps
1. Ensure you have a valid `config.json` present locally.

The default [config.json.sample](https://github.com/browserstack/enigma-public-central/blob/main/config.json.sample) should be sufficient to start.

You can then add module-specific configuration for the modules you want integrated with Enigma.
For detailed instructions on configuration, follow [this doc](/docs/Configuration%20Guide.md)

2. Add folder `db` in root folder of the repository.
3. Add a package `access_modules` inside `Access`.

Put this inside `__init__.py` of `access_modules`
```
from os.path import dirname, basename, isfile, join
import glob
modules = glob.glob(join(dirname(__file__), "*"))
__all__ = [basename(f) for f in modules if not isfile(f)]
```

4. Add access modules inside `access_modules` to integrate them with Enigma. (Optional and not needed to get started)


5. Install all the requirements through requirements.txt
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Run Migrate to create all the database tables.
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
7. Run the server
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Ensure that the 8000 port is free to use, and ensure that path to config.json is correct.

That's it! Enigma should be running locally on port 8000
